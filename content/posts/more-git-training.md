    <h2>Check-in</h2>
    <p>As the "product owner" of this course, I just want to review the "product" requirements at this point.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Each of you need, at minimum:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/posts/introduction#firstCriterion">10+ entries in your markdown "journal"</a>, kept in the <a href="https://github.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared git repo<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>*,</li>
        <li>at least one <em>documented</em> occasion where you served as a "<strong>scrum master</strong>" for your team,</li>
        <li>at least one approved <strong>pull request</strong> into the <strong>main branch</strong> of your team's shared repo** for a <strong>user-tested feature</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <div><small style="line-height:1.2;display: inline-block;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-top:1rem;">* I would also accept it being stored in your team's repo, provided you link to it from your file in the shared repo.</small></div>
    <div><small style="line-height:1.2;display: inline-block;">** All your team's work must be kept in a single team repository. Even if you are working on unrelated projects, this is necessary for the code review process.</small></div>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>As your teams move forward, it is your responsibility to make sure&hellip;</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <ul>
        <li>everyone on your team <strong>understands</strong> these requirements,</li>
        <li>you <strong>have a plan</strong> to meet these requirements.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section class="col" id="standup">
    <h2>Stand-up</h2>
    <p>Today you'll be running your first stand-up meeting.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose a scrum master and someone to keep notes.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Stand in a circle, and make sure any remote attendees can attend your meeting virtually.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>As a reminder, this is a short (<15 minutes) team meeting in which you go around the circle and say&hellip;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>what <strong>team-related work you did</strong> since the last stand-up,</li>
        <li>what you're <strong>gonna do</strong> now,</li>
        <li>anything that's preventing them from working (a '<strong>blocker</strong>').</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&hellip;so that everyone knows what everyone else is working on, and if they can help.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>As each person speaks, that person or the scrum master can make any <strong>updates to your feature tracking</strong> (i.e. move your Kanban cards to a different column).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If any issues (i.e. blockers) were raised, and couldn't be resolved in a short conversation, capture that information and plan to have an additional conversation.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Reminder for the Scrum Master: it is your responsibility to make sure the <strong>meeting stays short</strong>, the <strong>feature tracking gets updated</strong> properly, and <strong>blockers get resolved</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col" id="github-training">
    <h2>Github training</h2>
    <p>Working off of my <a href="/posts/generate-curate/">"Continue" item from last week</a>, we're going to learn more about how to navigate git/Github.</p>
    <p>For some of you, this will be a breeze. For others, you'll be trying some new things. Hopefully (since what you'll be doing isn't command-line based), this will remove some technical hurdles for first-timers.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Everyone must complete these modules, but you can work on them in your teams. If you have any questions, or get stuck, just ask your team mates!</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Here's what we're going to do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Complete the <a href="https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Github module<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> from <a href="https://github.com/skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Skills</a>.</li>
        <li>Complete the <a href="https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Review Pull Requests module<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>The only caveat is that when the module asks you to create a repo, I want you to do it in our "HTTP5214-Winter2023" organization.</p>

</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>After that, you can do everything as described by the modules themselves.</p>
    <p>While you're doing that, I'm going to organize 'Teams' in Github, so we're just going to take a minute to confirm that the teams are accurately represented in <a href="https://trello.com/b/LmkZMSIg/teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>

    <h2>Team time!</h2>
    <p>Now, you can start working on your research!</p><p>I encourage you to <strong>keep your research and meeting notes in your team repo</strong> (you may want to create a folder for each).</p><p>You also have the option to move your individual weekly logs into your team's repo (just make sure to link to it from your existing log file in the <code>main</code> branch of the course's <code>starter</code> repository).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Starting next week, I'll be checking in with your teams to see how well you're progressing (and documenting that progress).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>From now until the end of class, you'll have time to move forward with your research, but you may want to check in with your team and ask yourselves the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do we know how to let <strong>remote teammates</strong> join our ceremonies (team meetings)?</li>
        <li>Do we have all our <strong>team infrastructure</strong> (e.g. feature tracking, communications channel) set up? If not, do we know <strong>how we want to set it up</strong>? If there is set-up work to do, have we <strong>captured it in our feature tracking</strong> (i.e. assigned work to people)?</li>
        <li>Is our documentation capturing important information (i.e. who the scrum master is each week, task assignments, etc.)?</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Alright, go about your team-building and research, and don't forget to individually complete your weekly log!</p>
