Check in, stand up, git training, and team time!
================================================

[Slides](/slides//posts/more-git-training/)

Here is our agenda for today:

*   [Product owner check-in](#checkin) // 10:45-10:55
*   [Stand-up](#standup) // 10:55-11:10
*   [Additional Github Training](#github-training) // 11:10-11:40

*   [Create a team repository](#create-repo) // 11:55-12:05
*   [Team time!](#teamTime) // 12:05-12:30

Check-in
--------

As the "product owner" of this course, I just want to review the "product" requirements at this point.

Each of you need, at minimum:

*   [10+ entries in your markdown "journal"](/posts/introduction#firstCriterion), kept in the [shared git repo Opens in a new window](https://github.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/starter)\*,
*   at least one _documented_ occasion where you served as a "**scrum master**" for your team,
*   at least one approved **pull request** into the **main branch** of your team's shared repo\*\* for a **user-tested feature**.

\* I would also accept it being stored in your team's repo, provided you link to it from your file in the shared repo.

\*\* All your team's work must be kept in a single team repository. Even if you are working on unrelated projects, this is necessary for the code review process.

As your teams move forward, it is your responsibility to make sure…

*   everyone on your team **understands** these requirements,
*   you **have a plan** to meet these requirements.

Stand-up
--------

Today you'll be running your first stand-up meeting.

**Step 1**: Choose a scrum master and someone to keep notes.

**Step 2**: Stand in a circle, and make sure any remote attendees can attend your meeting virtually.

As a reminder, this is a short (<15 minutes) team meeting in which you go around the circle and say…

*   what **team-related work you did** since the last stand-up,
*   what you're **gonna do** now,
*   anything that's preventing them from working (a '**blocker**').

…so that everyone knows what everyone else is working on, and if they can help.

As each person speaks, that person or the scrum master can make any **updates to your feature tracking** (i.e. move your Kanban cards to a different column).

**Step 3**: If any issues (i.e. blockers) were raised, and couldn't be resolved in a short conversation, capture that information and plan to have an additional conversation.

Reminder for the Scrum Master: it is your responsibility to make sure the **meeting stays short**, the **feature tracking gets updated** properly, and **blockers get resolved**.

Github training
---------------

Working off of my ["Continue" item from last week](/posts/generate-curate/), we're going to learn more about how to navigate git/Github.

For some of you, this will be a breeze. For others, you'll be trying some new things. Hopefully (since what you'll be doing isn't command-line based), this will remove some technical hurdles for first-timers.

Everyone must complete these modules, but you can work on them in your teams. If you have any questions, or get stuck, just ask your team mates!

Here's what we're going to do:

1.  Complete the [Introduction to Github module Opens in a new window](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) from [Github Skills](https://github.com/skills).
2.  Complete the [Review Pull Requests module Opens in a new window](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests).

The only caveat is that when the module asks you to create a repo, I want you to do it in our "HTTP5214-Winter2023" organization.

![Click 'use this template'](/images/template.png)

First, click 'use this template'

![Click 'Create a repository'](/images/create-repo.png)

Then 'create a repository'

![Select our organization](/images/org.png)

Then select our organization from the 'owner' dropdown

After that, you can do everything as described by the modules themselves.

While you're doing that, I'm going to organize 'Teams' in Github, so we're just going to take a minute to confirm that the teams are accurately represented in [Trello Opens in a new window](https://trello.com/b/LmkZMSIg/teams).

A thing we have to do
---------------------

Creating your team's working repository
---------------------------------------

Only **one person on your team needs to do this**, but _someone_ has to, and you should discuss options as a team.

![Click the 'repositories' tab](/images/repositories.png)

First, go to [our Github organization Opens in a new window](https://github.com/orgs/HTTP5214-Winter2023) and click on the 'repositories' tab.

![Click 'New Repository'](/images/new-repo.png)

Then click the 'New Repository' button.

![Fill out the settings for the repository](/images/repo-info.png)

Fill out the settings for the new repository.

The **owner** should be HTTP5214-Winter2023.

The **repository name** should be "team-{the name of your team without spaces}".

Set the visibility to "**Public**".

Check the box for a "**README**" file.

_If_ you're confident most people will work with a particular language, choose the appropriate **.gitignore** file. Otherwise, you can leave this blank and [create your own Opens in a new window](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring).

[Choose a license](https://opensource.guide/legal/#which-open-source-license-is-appropriate-for-my-project). If you're not sure, choose "**MIT**" or "The Unlicense".

![Repo options in detail](/images/repo-info-detail.png)

Finally, click the "Create repository" button.

![Under 'Code', click 'Local' and clone as we did before.](/images/repo-team-clone.png)

Now your whole team can clone the repo onto your own machines. Under 'Code', click 'Local' and clone as we did before.

Team time!
----------

Now, you can start working on your research!

I encourage you to **keep your research and meeting notes in your team repo** (you may want to create a folder for each).

You also have the option to move your individual weekly logs into your team's repo (just make sure to link to it from your existing log file in the `main` branch of the course's `starter` repository).

Starting next week, I'll be checking in with your teams to see how well you're progressing (and documenting that progress).

From now until the end of class, you'll have time to move forward with your research, but you may want to check in with your team and ask yourselves the following questions:

*   Do we know how to let **remote teammates** join our ceremonies (team meetings)?
*   Do we have all our **team infrastructure** (e.g. feature tracking, communications channel) set up? If not, do we know **how we want to set it up**? If there is set-up work to do, have we **captured it in our feature tracking** (i.e. assigned work to people)?
*   Is our documentation capturing important information (i.e. who the scrum master is each week, task assignments, etc.)?

Alright, go about your team-building and research, and don't forget to individually complete your weekly log!
