    <h2>What is Version Control?</h2>
    <p>You might also be familiar with version control from applications like <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/view-previous-versions-of-office-files-5c1e076f-a9c9-41b8-8ace-f77b9642e2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MS Word<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, or from trying to manually manage versions.</p>

    <p>One of the most magical things about computers is the time-travel afforded to us by the concept of <code>undo</code> and <code>redo</code>. Extending this magic to <strong>every change made to a file</strong>, indefinitely, is a really powerful idea.</p>
    <p>Version control not only lets us step backwards and forwards in time, but with the concept of "<strong>branching</strong>", allows us to explore alternate timelines that diverge from, and then merge with, the main timeline.</p>

        <p><strong>Notice I'm saying 'git' and not 'Github'</strong> (despite the fact that pretty much everybody uses Github, too).</p>
        <p>That's because git is a piece of open-source software. Git<em>hub</em> is a company owned by Microsoft that lets you host your remote git repositories with them. You don't need Github to use git - you can host your own repositories, or host them with a Github competitor like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>

    <h4>What is a git repository?</h4>
    <p>A git repository, or "repo" for short, is a <strong>software project that uses git to keep track of its changes</strong>.</p>
    <p>Typically, you'll have a copy on your local machine (the "<strong>local repo</strong>"), and another copy on a server somewhere (the "<strong>remote repo</strong>").</p>

<section id="how-do-i-get-a-copy" class="col">
    <h4>How do I get a copy?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your terminal/command prompt, and <strong>change directories</strong> into the folder where you keep your projects, using the <code>cd</code> command for Mac/Linux or <code>Set-Location</code> for Windows.</li>

    <p>Alright, so now we've added the file to the git repo, and it's telling us to commit? <strong>Why do we have to commit it if we've already added it?</strong></p>
    <p>It's best to think of your repo having a "rough draft" stage. You work on stuff in your <strong>working directory</strong>, add it to your "<strong>rough draft</strong>", and when it's ready to be sync'd up with the remote repo (which, remember, other developers are working with), then you <strong>make your commits</strong>.</p>

    <p>Remember earlier when I said that git didn't just give us the option to time travel, but also to branch off into <strong>different timelines</strong>?</p>
    <p>With "branches", git allows us to <strong>split off temporarily</strong> from the existing repo, do our work, and push it to the remote repository without it affecting other developers.</p>
    <p>When your work is ready to be re-integrated with whatever other developers have been working on, you can <strong>merge your work back into the main branch</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Git branching is often a major part of how a team structures their workflow. There might not be a single "main" branch, but <strong>multiple branches that represent the development, testing and production versions</strong> of the application. Merging into different branches <strong>may trigger automated processes</strong>, like testing (which you've seen with our Github Classroom lab exercises), but also code compilation, optimization, deployments - all kinds of things.</p>
    <p>We'll look at how a team might structure their git workflow later in this lesson, but first, let's look at how git branching is done.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-branch" class="col">
    <h4>Creating a branch</h4>
    <p>Creating a branch in git is easy - just use the following command:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git branch [some-name-for-your-branch]</code></pre>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <figure>
        <div class="match-iterm"><img src="/images/git-branch.png" alt="Output of git branch commands"></div>
        <figcaption>You can see what branches are available, and which branch you're currently "on" with the command <code>git branch --list</code>, or simply <code>git branch</code></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Notice the asterisk (<code>*</code>) in the screenshot? That's indicating <strong>the branch that we're currently "on"</strong>. If you open the files in your code editor, <strong>the code you see will be the code stored in the branch with the asterisk</strong>. If we make changes to the code, we'll be making changes to, adding to, and committing to the code in the branch with the asterisk.</p>
</section>
<section id="checkout" class="col">
    <h4>Checking out a branch</h4>
    <p>To change which branch you're working on, you need to "<strong>check out</strong>" the branch that you want to switch to.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git checkout [some-name-for-your-branch]</code></pre>
    <figure>
        <div class="match-iterm"><img src="/images/git-checkout.png" alt="Output of git checkout command"></div>
        <figcaption>Look at that little asterisk go!</figcaption>
    </figure>
</section>
<section id="remote-branch" class="col">
    <h4>Creating a remote branch</h4>
    <p>Once you've created a branch and switched to it, you can add and commit files as usual. However, when it's time to push to the remote repository, the branch <strong>has to exist in the remote repo</strong> before you can push to it.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>We can do <strong>simultaneously create the remote branch and push our code</strong> in one line by writing the following command:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git push -u origin [some-name-for-your-branch]</code></pre>
    <figure>
        <a href="/images/git-branch-push.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/git-branch-push.png" alt="Output of git push when the branch hasn't been created on the remote"></a>
        <figcaption>Git's pretty good at telling you the commands you need to run to make stuff work. Not great, but pretty&nbsp;good.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>That's it! When you're ready, <strong>go to your remote repo and create a pull request</strong>, and <strong>get someone to code review it</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>If you're at this point, it's probably time to run the following commands to get started on your next task:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git checkout main
git pull
git branch [another-branch-name]
git checkout [another-branch-name]</code></pre>
    <p>This will <strong>put you back on your main branch</strong>, <strong>make sure your code is up-to-date</strong> with the remote repo, and <strong>put you on a whole new branch</strong> to begin your next piece of work.</p>

    <h2>How Do Teams Use Git?</h2>
    <p>As we talked about, git branching can be used to <strong>manage collaboration</strong>, and also to trigger <strong>powerful commands</strong> and <strong>deployment strategies</strong>. Let's talk about it!</p>
</section>

<section id="git-workflows" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Git workflows</h3>
    <p>A git workflow (or "branching model") is a <a href="/posts/methodologies-and-design-patterns/#why" target="_blank">team standard<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. Like other team standards, the most important thing is <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>
    <p>There are <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> <a href="https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branching<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> out there.</p>
    <p>I'm going to show you one today - GitLab Flow. It's one of the <strong>best-known git workflows</strong>, but expect different teams to use alternatives, or to have their own modified version of this one.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The precursor to GitLab Flow</h4>
    <p>The best-known git branching model is <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gitflow<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, first described by Vincent Driessen in 2010.</p><p>Gitflow was based on an older software development model where you <strong>released slowly</strong> and <strong>supported multiple versions</strong> of a piece of software. It involved a number of different types of branches, including multiple "main" branches, feature branches, "hotfix" branches for bug fixes that need to 'skip the queue', and so on. Since that software development lifecycle doesn't reflect most work on the web today, <strong>Driessen himself no longer recommends Gitflow</strong> for most web applications.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The (too?) simple competitor of GitLab Flow</h4>
    <p><a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Flow<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> was introduced a few years later as a lightweight alternative. Github Flow is <strong>essentially the simple workflow I described</strong> in the first part of this lesson:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">main [remote]
    → main [local] 
    → feature-branch [local] 
    → feature-branch [remote] 
    → pull request 
→ main [remote]</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="gitlab" class="col">
    <h4>GitLab Flow</h4>
    <p>GitLab Flow is what I consider a "<strong>happy medium</strong>" between these two.</p>
    <p>It allows for multiple "environment" branches - branches that reflect a staged deployment through QA, UAT, and production - without the complications of reflecting an outdated software development paradigm.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <img src="/images/gitlab-environment-branches.png" alt="GitLab Workflow environment branches.">
    <p>Developers still use a <strong>feature branching model</strong> (like Github Flow), working off a shared main branch, but <strong>other environments can be represented</strong> as "downstream" branches, in order to work with a multi-staged deployment.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>GitLab also nicely documents smaller details about the workflow, like <strong>when to run tests</strong>, <strong>how to open issues</strong>, and <strong>how to phrase your commit messages</strong>.</p>
    <p>All in all, a pretty nice system!</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Git and the deployment pipeline</h3>
    <p>A git workflow is often <strong>the basis for continuous integration/continuous deployment operations</strong>, also known as a "CI/CD pipeline".</p>
</section>
<section id="continuous-integration" class="col">
    <h4>Continuous Integration</h4>
    <p>Continuous integration is the practice of <strong>frequently</strong> (at least daily) <strong>merging developers' code</strong>, where <strong>each merge triggers automated testing on the main branch</strong>.</p><p>This prevents a bottleneck - the moment when a deadline comes up, all developers try to merge, and are faced with dozens of failed test and hundreds of merge conflicts.</p>
    </section>
<section id="continuous-deployment" class="col">
    <h4>Continuous Deployment</h4>
    <p>Continuous deployment means that your software is <strong>automatically deployed to production</strong> when it's ready (which is frequently, as continuous integration is a pre-requisite for continuous deployment).</p>
    <p>The definition of "ready" will depend on the workplace, but one simple example of this is in the <a href="/supplemental/netlify/" target="_blank">instructions for deploying via Netlify<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> that I provided to you wherein <strong>the site is made public anytime a commit</strong> (including a merge) <strong>is made</strong> into the main branch.</p>

    <h2>What is Code Review?</h2>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Code review is a common element of a team's workflow. In many teams, <strong>when your branch is ready to be merged into the main branch, you are required to ask for a code review</strong>. After another developer has reviewed your code, they may ask you to make changes to meet with team standards. <strong>When they approve of your code</strong>, <strong>they</strong> (not you) <strong>will then merge it into the main branch</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p class="callout warning">Just to reiterate, this is <strong>one possible workflow</strong>. I'm choosing to describe this workflow because it's quite common, but every team is different!</p>

    <p>A code review isn't a movie review!

</section>
<section id="understand" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Review to understand.</h3>
    <p>Use your own ability to understand the code you're reviewing as a benchmark for how well-written the code is. <strong>Don't let your <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/blog/impostor-syndrome-in-web-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impostor syndrome<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> be responsible for letting bad code into the code base!</strong> If the code isn't properly commented, uses non-standard syntax, or is badly convoluted, it probably isn't going to be much use to the team in the long run.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <strong>maybe you're right and you're a total dummy</strong>. Code review is a great chance to fix that! On most teams I've worked on, most other developers knew more than me about some aspect of coding, and I got to <strong>learn really cool stuff</strong> by asking questions during code review.</p>
</section>
<section id="succeed" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Review for success.</h3>
    <p><strong>Be positive in your code reviews!</strong> When someone does something cool, <strong>let them know</strong>. Your goal is not to point out mistakes, your goal is to <strong>have your team write great code</strong>.</p>
    <p>When you do need to request changes, <strong>be specific</strong>, and, where possible, <strong>point them in the direction of the resources they need</strong> - preferably internal team documentation.</p>
</section>
<section id="process-improvement" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Recognize where process needs&nbsp;improvement.</h3>
    <p>Code review should be your team's <strong>last line of defense</strong> before your code heads to the QA team.</p>
    <p>Syntax and style errors should be caught <strong>by the code author with automated testing</strong>. Anything not automated should be clearly described in the documentation. Only when automation and documentation falls short should you be requesting changes in code review.</p>
    <p>If you find yourself catching (or, heaven help you, discussing in the comments) things that <em>should</em> be caught by automation or documentation, it may not be an issue that should be resolved in a single code review - it should be <strong>logged and resolved as a team effort</strong>.</p>
