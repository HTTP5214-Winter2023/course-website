    <h2>Chaos</h2>
    <p>This class has been chaotic so far. This has probably been <strong>frustrating</strong> and <strong>confusing</strong> for some of you.</p>
    <p>I try, as a teacher, to only make you frustrated or confused when it is a frustration or confusion that really happens in the workplace. I do this so you can find solutions for it in a safer environment (i.e. the classroom).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>This course is about process and strategy. The reason we have process is to create structure and organization, and therefore <strong>avoid confusion</strong>. The reason we have Agile strategies is so that we're not so structured that we can't adapt. This is how we <strong>avoid frustration</strong>.</p>

    <p>Today we will continue to list <strong>pain points</strong>.</p>
    <p>I expect you'll have thought of some new ones now that you're a few weeks into your new classes.</p>
    <p>As a reminder, pain points are things that are <strong>boring / repetitive</strong> or <strong>hard to remember</strong>. Stuff associated with process and strategy is usually boring and/or hard to remember, but so is a lot of work associated with development - syntax, running tests, boilerplates, server configuration, sourcing placeholder art, etc. etc. etc.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Luckily for us, computers are really good at <strong>doing repetitive stuff</strong> and <strong>remembering things</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>We can automate <strong>literally anything a computer can do</strong>, creating triggers, sync'ing applications, passing in arguments, and/or chaining together commands.</p>
    <p>The list of things computers can do is getting bigger every day. If your pain point involves finding artwork, or sending a text or email, or writing (either English or code), these are all things that can be automated (albeit with some costs associated beyond a certain point).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>We can also have computers remember things for us in ways that are the most convenient for us - stored on a server that's <strong>accessible to us on all our devices</strong>, and/or on a <strong>collaborative platform</strong>, and/or in a format that's simple and <strong>easy to read</strong> and <strong>integrate with automations</strong>, and/or set up for <strong>automated reminders</strong> (both time- and location-based).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>We'll take 10 minutes for you to <strong>individually list</strong> some of your own "pain points". These can be things that are currently painful, or things you know you probably should do, but aren't currently doing because it's too much work. This can be school stuff, or any tasks outside of school (that maybe you've neglected because you're schooling so hard).</p>
    <p class="callout primary">Here are some of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/starter/main/pain-points.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pain points we listed<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> the first week.</p>
    <p>Once you have some pain points listed, we'll have 20 minutes for you to <strong>write out the steps</strong> involved in each painful task. Take note of <strong>anything that might change the next time</strong> you do this task. Take note of anything that <strong>you'd like to improve</strong> about how this task gets done. For each step, it may help you to mark it either (A) for action, or (M) for memory.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre class="language-plaintext"><code>Pain point: boilerplate folder structure
Description: It's hard to remember all the files and folders I should create for a project when I just want to start coding.</code></pre>
    <pre class="language-plaintext"><code>Steps:
1. Create a project folder
2. Create subfolders
3. Create boilerplate index.html, /js/script.js, /css/style.css</code></pre>
    <pre class="language-plaintext"><code>Note: this is for a static HTML site. Step 3 is slightly different for PHP projects.</code></pre>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre class="language-plaintext"><code>Pain point: remembering due dates
Description: I can manually put due dates for assignments in my google calendar, but they're scattered all over, and it doesn't reflect how much time each assignment will take.</code></pre>
    <pre class="language-plaintext"><code>Steps:
1. Take a note in class
2. Manually add to Google Calendar</code></pre>
    <pre class="language-plaintext"><code>Note: I wish I could see how much time each task will take, and how many marks each task is worth. That way I'd know what to prioritize.</code></pre>
</section>
<section>
    <p>After listing out your pain points, we'll get into groups based on solutions you'd like to explore for these pain points.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Documentation (collaborative 'wiki'-style note-keeping in plain text/markdown)</li>
        <li>Workflow automation (Github Actions, chaining together tools, testing, linting, etc.)</li>
        <li>Boilerplating (creating reproducible "start points" for coding projects)</li>
        <li>Task automation (having your own computer perform simple, repetitive tasks via shell scripting, Python, or similar)</li>
        <li>Something else - anything that at least 5 people would like to explore together (that can ultimately be captured in Github).</li>
    </ul>
