How will you ask them for their feedback afterwards? Write all this down. A script is best, but bullet points are required.</dd><dt><strong>Likes / Dislikes / Recommendations</strong></dt><dd>There are different types of feedback you could collect from your users, and if you would prefer to use, say, a System Usability Scale, that's totally fine. The <em>bare minimum</em> format for collecting user feedback is to ask for their likes, their dislikes and their recommendations.</dd></dl></div></div></div></div></article></main><script src=https://http5214.netlify.app//js/prism.js></script>
