    <h2>Things to think about while testing</h2>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>You should be user-testing your application today. If you're not doing it today, it needs to get done this week. (But you know I try to keep all the work for this class in this class.)</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>A reminder: though we have been talking about what good, thoughtful usability testing looks like in <a href="https://a11ycourse.ca/posts/the-2nd-week/#testPlan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that other course<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, the prototype testing you're doing in this course can be much more "bare bones".</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>That doesn't mean it should be <strong>sloppy</strong> or <strong>poorly thought out</strong>, just that the bar for rigor and polish is somewhat lower.</p>
    <p>Please review the <a href="/posts/team-time-power-go/#userTesting">bare minimum</a> set out last week.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Next week, you'll have your retrospective and sprint planning meetings.</p><p>In your <strong>retrospective</strong> you can review and finalize your documentation (remember - this is a <strong>requirement</strong> for a pass in this course).</p>
    <p>In your <strong>sprint planning</strong>, you can review the results of your tests, and decide on any changes you want to make to your product based on those results.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>If you still have not contributed to the main branch of the product (another requirement for passing this course), the <strong>sprint planning is the time to consider</strong> what (easily-completed) contribution you might make, that will be accepted and merged by your team.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>I'll also be coming around to each of your groups over the next two weeks to make sure that everyone has everything they need in place to pass.</p>
