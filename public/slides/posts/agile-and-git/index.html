    <h2>Team work in Agile</h2>
    <p>In agile development, teams are meant to be "cross-functional", meaning that each team member has an expertise, but also basic skills in all the jobs the team does.</p>
    <p>In the third week, you'll be broken up into individual teams of 5-10 people, and you'll start to run meetings for yourselves. This means one person in your team will need to be the "scrum master" - the person who runs the meeting. Every person on your team will need to lead at least <em>one meeting</em> over the course of the&hellip; course. (Don't worry too much, these meetings include the weekly stand-ups!) You <em>must</em> keep track of who lead which meeting in a document stored in Github. You can also keep track of any additional meeting notes you want to track in this document.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>The scrum master is responsible for conducting these meetings in a timely fashion, and for keeping the team positive and productive. The scrum master is also responsible for documenting meetings (although they can delegate the documentation to another team member).</p>
    <p>Here's how you run these meetings:</p>
</section>
<section id="standUps" class="col">
    <h3>How to run a "stand up"</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stand (duh) in a circle</li>
        <li>Go around the circle, with each person stating the following:
            <ol>
                <li>"Last time I worked on&hellip;"</li>
                <li>"This time I'm gonna work on&hellip;"</li>
                <li>"Here are the things preventing me from working&hellip;" (a.k.a. "blockers")</li>
            </ol> 
            <p class="callout primary"><small>Note that the last point should be about specific actions, i.e. "I'm waiting on the design," or "I'm waiting on code review". The goal is to make your team mates aware of how they can help.</small></p>
            <p>If this person can move a sticky note to a new column, they should do so now.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The scrum master's role in a stand-up</h4>
    <p>The scrum master's role is to&hellip;<ol><li>call the meeting,</li><li>assist in updating the Kanban board,</li><li>document the meeting,</li><li>co-ordinate with the product owner if the team identifies resources they need,</li><li>and help remove blockers.</li></ol></p>
</section>
<section id="sprintPlanning" class="col">
    <h3>How to run a sprint planning session</h3>
    <p>In your group&hellip;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Look at the work that needs doing, including anything in the backlog, and any proposed new work.</li>
        <li>Look at how much time you have available in the sprint.</li>
        <li>Assign tasks that could be accomplished within the sprint.</li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The scrum master's role in a sprint planning session</h4>
    <p>The scrum master's role is to&hellip;<ol><li>call the meeting,</li><li>go through the backlog items with the team,</li><li>document the meeting,</li><li>communicate the work being taken on with the product owner.</li></ol></p>
    <p class="callout primary"><small>Note: Product owners are usually in attendance for sprint planning sessions. I'll have to see how involved I can be when we've got a bunch going on simultaneously.</small></p>
</section>
<section id="retrospectives" class="col">
    <h3>How to run a sprint retrospective session</h3>
    <p>The goal of a retrospective is to improve <em>how the team works together</em>, a.k.a. the "process". This is a time for looking at how you communicate, document, and help each other.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>There are <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective-templates-and-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of possible formats<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> for prompting the team to think of things are going well, and could be improved. Here is one example, called "start, stop, continue":</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>In your group&hellip;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go around the circle and have each team member list one of each of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>A work practice you'd like to see the team <strong>start</strong> doing,</li>
                <li>a work practice you'd like the team to <strong>stop</strong>,</li>
                <li>a work practice you'd like the team to <strong>continue</strong> doing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Discuss these practices, and if the team agrees they would be willing to start or stop doing something, discuss <em>how</em> it would happen and <em>who</em> would take responsibility for it.</li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The scrum master's role in a sprint retrospective</h4>
    <p>The scrum master's role is to&hellip;<ol><li>choose the format,</li><li>call the meeting,</li><li>remind everyone that the meeting is a safe space to speak without interruption or judgement,</li><li>keep things positive and friendly,</li><li>make sure everyone is heard from,</li><li>if a team member takes responsibility that belongs on a sticky note, put it on the Kanban board,</li><li>document the meeting.</li></ol></p>

    <h2>How we'll work in git</h2>
    <p><em>Since some of you are new to git, I'm going to try to keep this as simple as possible. If things start to get messy, that's a great thing for us to work out in our sprint retrospective.</em></p>
    <p>Run this command in your terminal:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone git@github.com:HTTP5214-Winter2023/starter.git</code></pre>
    <p>This will create a copy of the git repo on your computer.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>To start working on your own version of the repo, use the command <code>git branch whateverYouWantToCallIt</code>. A 'branch' is a separate version of the code that can eventually get 'merged' back into the main code base, but keeps things separate while you (and others) are doing your own thing.</p>
    <p>In the folder '<code>starter</code>' that was just created, create a folder for your project.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Add any files or folders you need to in order to work on your project. These could be code files, documentation, etc.</p>
    <p>Whenever you add a file or folder, you'll want to run the command <code>git add .</code>. This gets all the new files and folders 'staged', ready to send to the remote repository (the one we all share, on Github).</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Whenever you do something worth saving, run the command <code>git commit -m 'Message about what you did'</code>.</p>
    <p>When you want to save your work to the remote repository, if it's your first time on this particular branch, run the command <code>git push -u origin whateverYouWantToCallIt</code>. This creates the branch in the remote repository, and sends your work there. After you've done it once (for this branch), you can just use the command <code>git push</code>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p><strong>If you're the only one working on this branch</strong>, then you can just push the code. <strong>If other people are also working on this branch</strong>, then before you push, run the command <code>git pull</code> to see if they've made any changes that might conflict with yours. If there are conflicts, resolve them, commit your resolutions, and push your work.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>When your code is ready to join the main branch of the project, you can go to your remote repo and create a pull request, and get someone to code review it. If the code reviewer wants you to make some changes, they can reject your PR (pull request), or, if they're happy, they can merge your code into the main project.</p>
    <p>Whenever you want to start on something new, switch back to the main branch, and create a new branch from there. (It's possible to branch from a branch, but I don't think you'll want to do that most of the time, unless you're doing some intense collaboration.)</p>
</section>
<section id="codeReview" class="col">
    <h3>Doing a code review</h3>
    <p>Okay, so as we just mentioned, you have to get a classmate to code review your work. How do you do that?</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>In the workplace, your team will probably have all kinds of requirements, both technical and social, on how to do this.</p>
    <p>We're going to keep it simple, though.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>When someone tags you in their PR, requesting a code review, you are going to look at the files that have changed, and <strong>see if you understand their code</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you don't understand their code, it's not because you're dumb, it's because they have formatted their code poorly, or haven't written descriptive comments.</p>
    <p>If you can't understand their code, let them know where you didn't understand stuff, and reject their pull request. This is not a mean thing to do (unless you're mean about it). It's doing the team a favour by making sure any code that makes it into the main branch is easy to work with.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>If you <em>can</em> understand their code, make sure there aren't any code conflicts or obvious errors, and that it does something worthwhile. Switch to their branch on your machine and try running their code. Does it work? Great! Does it do something useful? Awesome! Do you have any automated testing set up, and if so, has it passed the tests? Amazing! If it doesn't work, or do something obviously useful, or fails testing, you should reject the pull request (and let them know why), otherwise, you can merge it into the main branch!</p>

    <h2>What is Version Control?</h2>
    <p>You might also be familiar with version control from applications like <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/view-previous-versions-of-office-files-5c1e076f-a9c9-41b8-8ace-f77b9642e2c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MS Word<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, or from trying to manually manage versions.</p>

<section class="col">
    <p>One of the most magical things about computers is the time-travel afforded to us by the concept of <code>undo</code> and <code>redo</code>. Extending this magic to <strong>every change made to a file</strong>, indefinitely, is a really powerful idea.</p>
    <p>Version control not only lets us step backwards and forwards in time, but with the concept of "<strong>branching</strong>", allows us to explore alternate timelines that diverge from, and then merge with, the main timeline.</p>

        <p><strong>Notice I'm saying 'git' and not 'Github'</strong> (despite the fact that pretty much everybody uses Github, too).</p>
        <p>That's because git is a piece of open-source software. Git<em>hub</em> is a company owned by Microsoft that lets you host your remote git repositories with them. You don't need Github to use git - you can host your own repositories, or host them with a Github competitor like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>

    <h4>What is a git repository?</h4>
    <p>A git repository, or "repo" for short, is a <strong>software project that uses git to keep track of its changes</strong>.</p>
    <p>Typically, you'll have a copy on your local machine (the "<strong>local repo</strong>"), and another copy on a server somewhere (the "<strong>remote repo</strong>").</p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-i-get-a-copy" class="col">
    <h4>How do I get a copy?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your terminal/command prompt, and <strong>change directories</strong> into the folder where you keep your projects, using the <code>cd</code> command for Mac/Linux or <code>Set-Location</code> for Windows.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-center">Git branching</h3>
    <p>Remember earlier when I said that git didn't just give us the option to time travel, but also to branch off into <strong>different timelines</strong>?</p>
    <p>With "branches", git allows us to <strong>split off temporarily</strong> from the existing repo, do our work, and push it to the remote repository without it affecting other developers.</p>
    <p>When your work is ready to be re-integrated with whatever other developers have been working on, you can <strong>merge your work back into the main branch</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>Git branching is often a major part of how a team structures their workflow. There might not be a single "main" branch, but <strong>multiple branches that represent the development, testing and production versions</strong> of the application. Merging into different branches <strong>may trigger automated processes</strong>, like testing, code compilation, optimization, deployments - all kinds of things.</p>
    <p>We'll look at how a team might structure their git workflow later in this lesson, but first, let's look at how git branching is done.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-branch" class="col">
    <h4>Creating a branch</h4>
    <p>Creating a branch in git is easy - just use the following command:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git branch [some-name-for-your-branch]</code></pre>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <figure>
        <div class="match-iterm"><img src="/images/git-branch.png" alt="Output of git branch commands"></div>
        <figcaption>You can see what branches are available, and which branch you're currently "on" with the command <code>git branch --list</code>, or simply <code>git branch</code></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Notice the asterisk (<code>*</code>) in the screenshot? That's indicating <strong>the branch that we're currently "on"</strong>. If you open the files in your code editor, <strong>the code you see will be the code stored in the branch with the asterisk</strong>. If we make changes to the code, we'll be making changes to, adding to, and committing to the code in the branch with the asterisk.</p>
</section>
<section id="checkout" class="col">
    <h4>Checking out a branch</h4>
    <p>To change which branch you're working on, you need to "<strong>check out</strong>" the branch that you want to switch to.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git checkout [some-name-for-your-branch]</code></pre>
    <figure>
        <div class="match-iterm"><img src="/images/git-checkout.png" alt="Output of git checkout command"></div>
        <figcaption>Look at that little asterisk go!</figcaption>
    </figure>
</section>
<section id="remote-branch" class="col">
    <h4>Creating a remote branch</h4>
    <p>Once you've created a branch and switched to it, you can add and commit files as usual. However, when it's time to push to the remote repository, the branch <strong>has to exist in the remote repo</strong> before you can push to it.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>We can do <strong>simultaneously create the remote branch and push our code</strong> in one line by writing the following command:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git push -u origin [some-name-for-your-branch]</code></pre>
    <figure>
        <a href="/images/git-branch-push.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/git-branch-push.png" alt="Output of git push when the branch hasn't been created on the remote"></a>
        <figcaption>Git's pretty good at telling you the commands you need to run to make stuff work. Not great, but pretty&nbsp;good.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>That's it! When you're ready, <strong>go to your remote repo and create a pull request</strong>, and <strong>get someone to code review it</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>If you're at this point, it's probably time to run the following commands to get started on your next task:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">git checkout main
git pull
git branch [another-branch-name]
git checkout [another-branch-name]</code></pre>
    <p>This will <strong>put you back on your main branch</strong>, <strong>make sure your code is up-to-date</strong> with the remote repo, and <strong>put you on a whole new branch</strong> to begin your next piece of work.</p>

    <p>I'm going to show you one today - GitLab Flow. It's one of the <strong>best-known git workflows</strong>, but expect different teams to use alternatives, or to have their own modified version of this one.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The precursor to GitLab Flow</h4>
    <p>The best-known git branching model is <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gitflow<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, first described by Vincent Driessen in 2010.</p><p>Gitflow was based on an older software development model where you <strong>released slowly</strong> and <strong>supported multiple versions</strong> of a piece of software. It involved a number of different types of branches, including multiple "main" branches, feature branches, "hotfix" branches for bug fixes that need to 'skip the queue', and so on. Since that software development lifecycle doesn't reflect most work on the web today, <strong>Driessen himself no longer recommends Gitflow</strong> for most web applications.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <h4>The (too?) simple competitor of GitLab Flow</h4>
    <p><a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Flow<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> was introduced a few years later as a lightweight alternative. Github Flow is <strong>essentially the simple workflow I described</strong> in the first part of this lesson:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-console">main [remote]
    → main [local] 
    → feature-branch [local] 
    → feature-branch [remote] 
    → pull request 
→ main [remote]</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="gitlab" class="col">
    <h4>GitLab Flow</h4>
    <p>GitLab Flow is what I consider a "<strong>happy medium</strong>" between these two.</p>
    <p>It allows for multiple "environment" branches - branches that reflect a staged deployment through QA, UAT, and production - without the complications of reflecting an outdated software development paradigm.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <img src="/images/gitlab-environment-branches.png" alt="GitLab Workflow environment branches.">
    <p>Developers still use a <strong>feature branching model</strong> (like Github Flow), working off a shared main branch, but <strong>other environments can be represented</strong> as "downstream" branches, in order to work with a multi-staged deployment.</p>
</section>
<section class="col">
    <p>GitLab also nicely documents smaller details about the workflow, like <strong>when to run tests</strong>, <strong>how to open issues</strong>, and <strong>how to phrase your commit messages</strong>.</p>
    <p>All in all, a pretty nice system!</p>

</section>
<section id="continuous-integration" class="col">
    <h4>Continuous Integration</h4>
    <p>Continuous integration is the practice of <strong>frequently</strong> (at least daily) <strong>merging developers' code</strong>, where <strong>each merge triggers automated testing on the main branch</strong>.</p><p>This prevents a bottleneck - the moment when a deadline comes up, all developers try to merge, and are faced with dozens of failed test and hundreds of merge conflicts.</p>

    <h2>Giving good feedback</h2>
    <p>A code review isn't a movie review! Movie reviewers aren't <strong>on the same team</strong> as the filmmakers, don't get to <strong>ask for changes</strong>, and don't have to <strong>sit next to them at team lunches</strong>. <strong>Code reviews are part of a collaborative process</strong>.</p>
    <p>To quote Springsteen paraphrasing civil rights badass <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRCUUzpfV7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fannie Lou Hamer<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, "nobody wins unless everybody wins".</p>

<section id="understand" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Review to understand.</h3>
    <p>Use your own ability to understand the code you're reviewing as a benchmark for how well-written the code is. <strong>Don't let your <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/blog/impostor-syndrome-in-web-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impostor syndrome<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> be responsible for letting bad code into the code base!</strong> If the code isn't properly commented, uses non-standard syntax, or is badly convoluted, it probably isn't going to be much use to the team in the long run.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <strong>maybe you're right and you're a total dummy</strong>. Code review is a great chance to fix that! On most teams I've worked on, most other developers knew more than me about some aspect of coding, and I got to <strong>learn really cool stuff</strong> by asking questions during code review.</p>
</section>
<section id="succeed" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Review for success.</h3>
    <p><strong>Be positive in your code reviews!</strong> When someone does something cool, <strong>let them know</strong>. Your goal is not to point out mistakes, your goal is to <strong>have your team write great code</strong>.</p>
    <p>When you do need to request changes, <strong>be specific</strong>, and, where possible, <strong>point them in the direction of the resources they need</strong> - preferably internal team documentation.</p>
</section>
<section id="process-improvement" class="col">
    <h3 class="text-center">Recognize where process needs&nbsp;improvement.</h3>
    <p>Code review should be your team's <strong>last line of defense</strong> before your code heads to the QA team.</p>
    <p>Syntax and style errors should be caught <strong>by the code author with automated testing</strong>. Anything not automated should be clearly described in the documentation. Only when automation and documentation falls short should you be requesting changes in code review.</p>
    </section>
<section class="col">
    <p>If you find yourself catching (or, heaven help you, discussing in the comments) things that <em>should</em> be caught by automation or documentation, it may not be an issue that should be resolved in a single code review - it should be <strong>logged and resolved as a team effort</strong>.</p>
